We’re using Discussions as a public place to connect with the members of our community. We have categories to make topics easier to find:
Any member can:

* Ask questions and share answers. Q&A 🙏
* Show and tell your work. Share any projects **you** are working on or completed to make research software visible 🙌 ( tweet, post to drive traffic here and start a conversation)
* Engage with other community members in the general chat 💬 this is specially for sharing events, news, articles
* Ideas 💡 if you want to start working on a project and you want to invite others to join this is the right place.
* The co-hosts will use Announcements 📢 to share relevant information about connecting the community

Remember that this is a community we build together 💪.

The co-hosts will monitor the discussions and help moving discussion to the right category, if needed.
