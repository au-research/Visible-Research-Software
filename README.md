# Visible Research Software Interest Group

## Overview

The Visible Research Software Interest Group is a space for community conversation, i.e. an online forum for people within Australasian Research Institutions to discuss visibility of research software, e.g. citation, publication, and FAIRification.
The Visible Research Software Interest Group acts as a catalyst to jump-start coordinated activities designed to improve the visibility of research software assets to recognise authors of research software and improve the sustainability of those assets.

## Goals

Stimulate community participation to share existing guidance, embrace new ideas (policy, incentives, partnerships, etc. ), expand networking and advance together.
Increase awareness of national and international guidance to improve the visibility of research software locally by encouraging reflection and adoption. 

## Research Software Definition

Research software is defined to include source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables created during the research process or for a research purpose. Software components (e.g. operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) used for research but not created during or specifically for research should be considered software in research and not research software ([Gruenpeter et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.5504016)).
